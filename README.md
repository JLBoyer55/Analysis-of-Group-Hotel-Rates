# Analysis of Hotel Room Rates
## Motivation
I work for a company that has built an online platform for meeting planners to source and book hotels for group travel based on specified criteria.  In general, hotels market to two types of customers:

•	Leisure travelers consist of individuals or groups of fewer than 10 people who typically book rooms on a short-term basis

•	Group travelers consist of 10 more people who book farther in advance

Unlike leisure travel, group rooms cannot be booked online, and there is limited visibility into pricing for group rooms.  Hotel pricing is dynamic due to the perishable inventory, and hotels use yield management strategies to optimize rate and occupancy.  There is no central platform for buyers and sellers to exchange information on pricing, availability and buying criteria.  My company is addressing the booking inefficiencies by automating the search process with software.  I wanted to analyze pricing patterns for group rates and answer the following questions: 
	How can you assess value when comparing room rates for different destinations?  
	How do rates vary by region over time?  
	Is there a relationship between group and leisure room rates?
  

## Data  
To answer these questions, I used daily room rate pricing data from 2018 for 58 U.S. regions.  This data was purchased from a third party and provided to me by my company.  I aggregated the data by month and region to analyze patterns for the year.
